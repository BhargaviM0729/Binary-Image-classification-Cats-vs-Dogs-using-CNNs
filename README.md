# Binary Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs Using CNNs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. Using the Kaggle "Dogs vs Cats" dataset, the goal is to develop a binary classification model capable of distinguishing between the two classes. The project involves preprocessing data, building a deep learning model, training and evaluation, and testing with real-world inference.

---

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.

- **Training Set**: Contains images of cats and dogs.
- **Validation Set**: Split from the training set (20% of the total data) for performance monitoring.
- **Test Set**: Unseen data used to evaluate the model's generalization.

### Dataset Directory Structure
The dataset is organized into the following directory structure:

```
/dogs_vs_cats
    /train
        /cats
        /dogs
    /test
        /cats
        /dogs
```

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Resizing**: All images are resized to \(150 \times 150\) pixels.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are rescaled between \(0\) and \(1\) for efficient training.
- **Data Splitting**: The training set is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets using `ImageDataGenerator`.

---

### 2. Model Architecture
The model is built using the **Keras Sequential API**, consisting of:

- **Convolutional Layers**:
  - Extract spatial features with filters.
  - Use `ReLU` activation for non-linearity.
- **Pooling Layers**:
  - Downsample feature maps using MaxPooling.
- **Fully Connected Layers**:
  - Flatten the feature maps.
  - Dense layers with `ReLU` activation.
  - Sigmoid activation at the output layer for binary classification.

### 3. Model Training
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

The model is trained for **5 epochs** using `train_generator` and validated using `validation_generator`.

---

### 4. Evaluation
- Performance metrics like accuracy and loss are visualized using plots.
- Confusion matrix and classification reports provide insights into prediction accuracy for each class.

---

### 5. Testing and Inference
The model is tested on an unseen dataset to evaluate its generalization capability. A utility function enables single-image prediction, displaying the image and its predicted class.
